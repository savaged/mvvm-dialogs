# mvvm-dialogs
Framework simplifying the concept of opening dialogs from a view model when using MVVM in WPF or UWP.

Forked first following the request for change to the issue with solutions having views split out to separate sub-project:
https://github.com/FantasticFiasco/mvvm-dialogs/issues/27 

This version allows the standard dialog locator (based on naming convention) to work with separated projects.
